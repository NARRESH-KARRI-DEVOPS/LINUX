grep
—---
grep  "UNix" abc.txt
grep -i "UNix" abc.txt
grep -c "unix" abc.txt  find the number of lines that matches

grep -l "unix"  * —>display the files that contain the given string/pattern.
grep -w "unix" abc.txt → search all words

grep -o "unix" abc.txt  —> only matched content

grep -n "unix" abc.txt  —> shows the line number
grep -v "unix" abc.txt  → lines will display without matching

grep -B5 "error" demo.txt
grep -A5 "error" demo.txt
grep -C5 "error" demo.txt  → before and after

grep -iR geeks /home/geeks


wc
—
It is used to find out the number of lines, word count, byte and characters count in the files specified in the file arguments.
By default it displays four-columnar output.
First column shows number of lines present in a file specified, second column shows number of words present in the file, third column shows number of characters present in file and fourth column itself is the file name which are given as argument.
wc abc.txt
wc -l state.txt  → number of lines
wc -w state.txt number of words
wc -c state.txt number of words → bytes[characters]



umask [user mask]

normal        0022        644              755
  RHEL 9.x —-> umask value is same

Base permissions for file is: 0666

create one dir and file —> explain the permissions

How to change the umask value?
only root user
umask →display umask value
umask 222 

NOTE: permissions are not going to change for previous files and directories.

===================

Understanding File Permissions
In Linux, each file and directory has three types of permissions:

Read (r): Permission to read the file or list the directory.
Write (w): Permission to modify the file or add/remove files in a directory.
Execute (x): Permission to execute a file or access a directory.
Permissions can be assigned to three types of users:

User (u): The owner of the file.
Group (g): The group associated with the file.
Others (o): All other users.
Permission Representation
Permissions can be represented in two ways:

Symbolic Notation:

r: Read
w: Write
x: Execute
-: No permission
Example: -rwxr-xr-- indicates:

User has read, write, and execute permissions.
Group has read and execute permissions.
Others have read permission.
Numeric (Octal) Notation:

Permissions can also be represented as a three-digit number.
Each permission is represented by a binary digit:
Read = 4
Write = 2
Execute = 1
Example: rwx = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7, r-x = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5, r-- = 4 + 0 + 0 = 4





chmod
—-------
The chmod command in Linux is used to change the permissions of files and directories. It stands for "change mode" and allows users to define who can read, write, or execute a file.



user  group  others
rwx	   r_x   rw_


chmod 000 devops.txt

cat devops.txt  → to see


chmod 444 devops.txt
    or
chmod +r devops.txt


chmod 766 devops.txt
     or 
chmod u+rwx,go+rw devops.txt


chmod 777 devops.txt
   or
chmod ugo+rwx devops.txt


chmod u+x file.txt  # Adds execute permission for the user
chmod g+w file.txt  # Adds write permission for the group


chmod o-r file.txt  # Removes read permission for others
chmod u-w file.txt  # Removes write permission for the user


chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r file.txt  # Sets permissions explicitly


chmod -v 644 file.txt --> what changes done it will show.




NOTE: user has write permission , But unable to open why? pls check the read permmission


Note : if you want you want to remove use [ - ]


IQ] what is the diff between 400 and ugo+r




Directories
—-----------
chmod 444 DevOps/ [Only parent dir permissions will change]
chmod ugo+x DevOps/


ls -lrth DevOps/

chmod -R 444 DevOps/ → Sub directories will change

 Q: 777 [numbers will override]
     ugo+rwx [ will not override]
